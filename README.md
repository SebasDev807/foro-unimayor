## How to Contribute

### Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another. We're striving to make [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) an inclusive
environment that's great for first time open-source contributors.

Conventional Commits use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/<your_profile_name>/foro-unimayor.git

# or SSH
git clone git@github.com:<your_profile_name>/foro-unimayor.git
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```bash
  # using npm
  npm install
```

4. setup the environment variables on .env file.

   > **_NOTE:_** you can copy the .env.example file and rename itto .env. Don't forget to fill the variables with the correct values.

5. Run the application.

```bash
  # using npm
  npm run dev
```

### Pull Requests

3. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement.
4. Send a pull request from each feature branch to **main** branch.
